# Hey There

You found my profile; thanks for checking it out!  
  
My name is Paul. I'm constantly on the lookout for projects and ideas that can take my programming and design skills to the next level.  
  
Recently, I've been studying game development using the [LÃ–VE](https://www.love2d.org) framework and working on an [RPG Prototype](http://github.com/paulpls/rpg-prototype) to get a feel for how all the components fit together. I've learned a lot about old-school game design practices throughout my work on this project!  
  
Previously, I worked with a small tech startup to build a RESTful API with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) and its application frontend using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).  
  
I have a special fondness for automation using bash and python scripting. I enjoy creating tools for both professional and personal workflows that will provide continuous value. Saving time in this way allows us to focus on more important matters while maintaining predictable access to the information we require.  
  
In a past life, I volunteered with a small team of peers as a Systems Administrator for Fantasia Universe, a Minecraft server which boasted a decade-long uptime and rich community until its sunset in 2016. Together, my teammates and I would meet regularly to discuss ongoing projects, organize public events, conquer bugs, and manage personnel, all the while ensuring that our users' needs were taken care of every step of the way.  


## Values
These are some things in which I strongly believe:
  
**Free and open-source software is tantamount to a sustainable future.**  
Users should be empowered to maintain and change software to suit their needs, even after development has ceased to be active. Software that restricts users' freedom is not an equitable design practice. 
  
**Accessibility is a first-class, all-encompassing concern.**  
Technology should work to make everyone's lives better. It is the responsibility of every development team worth their salt to ensure everyone has a fair chance. No one should ever be left out or be unable to participate due to a difference in ability.  

**Flow is life.**  
It is only when we flow together that we can truly understand one another and begin to thrive.  
Every aspect of our lives can be improved if we strive to find balance.  

## Let's Talk
Please reach out to me if you wish to discuss employment opportunities, collaborate on a project, or just say hello!  
  
If you're in the D.C. area, let's do the thing.
